# RRP - Robotic Leg
A robotic leg simplified to a RRP manipulator. The file rrp_FK_IK contains the forward and inverse kinematics calculations for a RRP manipulator, as shown in the figure below. The code plots the result given joint values [q1, q2, q3] (FK) or [xc,yc,zc] end-point position. It also plots the workspace.
